# Monkey Interpreter in Rust

This project is an implementation of the Monkey programming language interpreter in Rust, adapting the methods based on the book *[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)* by Thorsten Ball.

## Overview

Monkey is a simple, dynamically typed, interpreted language. It supports a variety of programming features including variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, functions, and more. This interpreter is a complete implementation of the language as described in the book.

## Features

- **Arithmetic expressions**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Boolean expressions**: Implements logical operations like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!`, `&&`, and `||`.
- **Conditionals**: Supports `if-else` statements.
- **Variables**: Allows declaration and assignment of variables.
- **Functions**: Supports first-class functions with closures.
- **Built-in functions**: Includes a set of built-in functions for basic operations.
